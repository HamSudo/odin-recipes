    <h1>Taco Salad III</h1>
      <img src="../recipes-images/taco-salad.jpg">
    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Taco Salad III is a classic, hearty American Tex‑Mex dish designed to serve a group—typically eight—with a satisfying mix of flavors and textures. At its core is seasoned lean ground beef, cooked with taco seasoning and combined in a large bowl with iceberg lettuce, chopped red and green onions, pinto and kidney beans, diced tomatoes, cubed avocado, and shredded Cheddar cheese. Just before serving, a bag of corn chips is added for crunch, and the salad is dressed generously with Catalina dressing, resulting in a rich, tangy, and slightly sweet toss that brings everything together.</p>
      <p>This salad is ideal for a warm day or casual gathering, as it’s quick to prepare (about 30 minutes total) and easy to scale up. The contrast between creamy avocado, crisp lettuce and chips, hearty beans and beef, and bold Catalina dressing makes each bite a flavorful balance. With around 945 calories per serving, it’s definitely a filling meal—perfect for sharing or meal prepping over a few days.</p>
