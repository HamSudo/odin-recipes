    <h1>Cobb Salad</h1>
      <img src="../recipes-images/cobb-salad.jpg">
    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Cobb salad is a hearty, American-style salad known for its colorful presentation and rich combination of ingredients. Traditionally served as a main course, it features chopped greens—usually romaine, iceberg lettuce, or watercress—topped with neatly arranged rows of diced chicken breast, crispy bacon, hard-boiled eggs, avocado, tomatoes, blue cheese, and chives. The ingredients are typically laid out in stripes or sections on top of the greens rather than mixed together, giving the salad its signature composed look.</p>
      <p>The salad is usually dressed with a red wine vinaigrette, though variations may use ranch, blue cheese, or other dressings. Originating in the 1930s at the Brown Derby restaurant in Hollywood, the Cobb salad was reportedly created by the restaurant's owner, Robert Cobb, as a late-night kitchen improvisation. Its balance of protein, healthy fats, and fresh vegetables makes it both satisfying and nutritious, offering a filling meal that feels both indulgent and wholesome.</p>
